For a brief overview of my education and employment history, see my [resume](https://github.com/marcoswastaken/my-skills/blob/main/Marcos_Ortiz_Resume_2023.pdf)

# Objective

To better understand machine learning and data scienc, and find ways that I can contribute in this field. 

# Progress

I feel that I have developed a solid understanding of the basic theory behind these tools, as well as some of their application to real world data and problems.

My confidence has greatly increased, and I am eager to play more.


# Independent Study

I have utilized a variety of resources for independent study, and I feel that I have been fairly successful so far. Some of the highlights of my independent studies so far are summariezed below.

## Python Programming

While I had used programming in python in my graduate research, I felt that it would be beneficial to gain a better understanding of the fundamentals of the language, including data structures and algorithms. Some of this preliminary study includes:
- Completing MIT's opencourseware offering [6.0001 Introduction to Computer Science and Programming in Python](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-0001-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-in-python-fall-2016/)
- Completing coding exercises on [leetcode](https://leetcode.com/marcoswastaken/)

## Machine Learning

Once I was feeling more confident with my python programing skills, I focused my efforts on building an understanding of the tools and technology involved in Machine Learning (ML):

- Completed the **Machine Learning Specialization** course by Stanford University and DeepLearning.AI offered on Coursera. This involced earning certificate in three courses:
   - Supervised Machine Learning: Regression and Classification
   - Advanced Learning Algorithms
   - Unsupervised Learning, Reccomenders, Rienforcment Learning
- Independent Practice
   - Completed coursework and exercises from Jeff Heaton's course at Washington University in St. Louis, [T81 558:Applications of Deep Neural Networks](https://sites.wustl.edu/jeffheaton/t81-558/)
   - Worked with public datasets to practice applying what I've learned
    - Here's a jupyter notebook I wrote while learning about Bayesian Hyperparameter optimization: [link](https://github.com/marcoswastaken/ML_practice/blob/main/Bayesian_HPO_example_01.ipynb)

## SQL

I have also begun to familiarize myself with SQL tools:
- Completing the tutorial exercises on [SQLZoo](https://sqlzoo.net/wiki/SQL_Tutorial)
- Completing SQL exercises on [leetcode](https://leetcode.com/marcoswastaken/)
