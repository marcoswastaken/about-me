# About Me

I am a researcher, scientist, mathematician, teacher, and student. I love to explore technical questions and puzzles, and learn about new technology and tools that can be applied to solving problems. 

My academic and professional adventures, so far, have taught me a lot about myself, my strengths, and the kind of work that I find most rewarding.

### Some of my strengths
- I am a fast learner, especially when it comes to technical tools and concepts
- I pay attention to details, even when the machinery involved is very complicated
- When I get stuck, I am able to be flexible in my thinking and approach, and find a new way to attack the problem
- I am a good communicator, both in expressing my own ideas and in listening to the ideas of my collaborators

### Work that I find rewarding:
- Projects where I have the opportunity to collaborate with others, to learn together and work towards common goals
- Developing or improving products that have a positive impact on entire communities
- Challenging problems that involve tools and ideas from different disciplines

I have recently become particularly interested in developments in machine learning, and data science. I am working to develop my skills with these tools to explore new problems and opportunities.

# Recent Developments

To build up my skills with machine learning and data science, I have utilized a variety of resources for independent study.

## Python Programming

While I had used programming in python in my graduate research, I felt that it would be beneficial to gain a better understanding of the fundamentals of the language, including data structures and algorithms. Some of this preliminary study includes:
- Completing MIT's opencourseware offering [6.0001 Introduction to Computer Science and Programming in Python](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-0001-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-in-python-fall-2016/)
- Completing coding exercises on [leetcode](https://leetcode.com/marcoswastaken/)

## Machine Learning

Once I was feeling more confident with my python programing skills, I focused my efforts on building an understanding of the tools and technology involved in Machine Learning (ML):

- Completed the **Machine Learning Specialization** course by Stanford University and DeepLearning.AI offered on Coursera. This involced earning certificate in three courses:
   - Supervised Machine Learning: Regression and Classification
   - Advanced Learning Algorithms
   - Unsupervised Learning, Reccomenders, Rienforcment Learning
- Independent Practice
   - Completed coursework and exercises from Jeff Heaton's course at Washington University in St. Louis, [T81 558:Applications of Deep Neural Networks](https://sites.wustl.edu/jeffheaton/t81-558/)
   - Worked with public datasets to practice applying what I've learned

Some key concepts and tools I've built some familiarity with include:
- Tensorflow
- Keras
- Pandas
- Baysian Hyperparameter Optimization

## SQL

I have also begun to familiarize myself with SQL tools:
- Completing the tutorial exercises on [SQLZoo](https://sqlzoo.net/wiki/SQL_Tutorial)
- Completing SQL exercises on [leetcode](https://leetcode.com/marcoswastaken/)
