# About Me


I am a researcher, scientist, mathematician, teacher, and student. I love to explore technical questions and puzzles, and learn about new technology and tools that can be applied to solving problems. 

My academic and professional adventures, so far, have taught me a lot about myself, my strengths, and the kind of work that I find most rewarding.

Some of my strengths:
- I am a fast learner, especially when it comes to technical tools and concepts
- I pay attention to details, even when the machinery involved is very complicated
- When I get stuck, I am able to be flexible in my thinking and approach, and find a new way to attack the problem
- I am a good communicator, both in expressing my own ideas and in listening to the ideas of my collaborators

Work that I find rewarding:
- Projects where I have the opportunity to collaborate with others, to learn together and work towards common goals
- Developing or improving products that have a positive impact on entire communities
- Challenging problems that involve tools and ideas from different disciplines

I have recently become particularly interested in developments in machine learning, and data science. I am working to develop my skills with these tools to explore new problems and opportunities.

# Experience

## Machine Learning and Data Science
To build a foundation in data science, I have relied primarily on independent study. I have completed several certifications, and completed coursework from a various open educational resources. Some highlights include:

- Certificates:
  - Machine Learning Specialization (July 2023) [certificate](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/specialization/certificate/CL9C8ZWVH2BG)
  - Unsupervised Learning, Recommenders, Reinforcement Learning (July 2023) [certificate](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/certificate/XFB5Z367R3VM)
  - Advanced Learning Algorithms (June 2023) [certificate](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/certificate/6NLAHG7P6WJQ)
  -  Supervised Machine Learning: Regression and Classification (May 2023) [certificate](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/certificate/TDX8X87TPF7W)

In the notes and lab exercises accompanying these certificates I developed familiarity with many fundamental concepts and machine learning tools, including:
 - Using popular machine learning libraries like NumPy and scikit-learn
 - Building and training supervised machine learning models for prediction and binary classification tasks, including linear regression and logistic regression
 - Supervised learning (multiple linear regression, logistic regression, neural networks, and decision trees)
 - Unsupervised learning (clustering, dimensionality reduction, recommender systems),
 - Best practices for artificial intelligence and machine learning innovation (evaluating and tuning models, taking a data-centric approach to improving performance)

Building on this foundation, I have practiced implementing these tools on publicly available datasets to hone my skills. This has included practice with hyper-parameter tuning (e.g. using Bayesian Optimization) and broader set of optimizers and activation functions.

## Programming

The many parallels between mathematical structures and those in compute science and programming have provided me with a high level of comfort in both worlds. My primary language is python, but I have some experience with a wide variety of languages and frameworks, such as C/C++, java, SQL, and MATLAB. I am undaunted by learning new syntax, and I am comfortable with the principles of object oriented programming.

In my graduate research, I was exploring an abstract set of objects that interacted with one another with predictable results. However, as the set of involved objects grew, the complexity of the computations measuring these interactions became exponentially more expensive, and soon became intractable by hand. To make progress on this problem I modeled these structures and their interactions using python classes and functions. The end result was a successful classification (and thus a completed thesis, woot!)
